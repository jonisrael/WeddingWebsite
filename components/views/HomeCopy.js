    <p>
      Our story begins in the Spring of 2019. Susanna was teaching second grade
      at an elementary school in Saint Louis and Jon was travelling around to
      different schools teaching chess. He was assigned to Susanna's school on
      Friday afternoons and Susanna was in charge of monitoring the group he was
      teaching. Humor is always one of the first things Susanna noticed in a guy
      and Jon had many dumb jokes and funny phrases. He was so cute and
      hilarious. Over time, Susanna realized she had a crush on Jon and, when
      his time of working at her school was done, sent him an email saying thank
      you and inviting him to be a volunteer for a field trip to a Cardinals'
      baseball game. Jon and Susanna emailed back and forth (he was pretty sure
      there was more going on than just needing volunteers) and Jon skipped
      class to meet up at the baseball game. We made plans to go out to eat that
      weekend and have been together since. Susanna likes to say that she's only
      ever asked one guy out and it worked!
